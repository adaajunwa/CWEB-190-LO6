    <!-- For extra practice, try making this page so that clicking on
         the heading for a question switches between showing and hiding
         the answers.  Then try to get an "accordion" effect, where only
         one answer is ever shown (so clicking on a heading will
         show the answer to that question, but hide the answers to all
         other questions).  -->

    is 42. On the other hand,
    the Dalai Lama reportedly said the meaning of life is happiness, and
    that the real question is how you achieve happiness. Is it through wealth
    and possessions, or through caring and compassion for others? Is it being
    able to command others, or being in service to others?</p>
